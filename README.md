DivvyUp ("Divvy") is an algorithm that draws on the 2018 daily historical data of 5,943 stocks traded across the major U.S. exchanges (Nasdaq, NYSE, AmEx). Divvy then uses that data to assess an entered portfolio for overall diversity in terms of momentum, which is the daily percent change in an asset's value.   

Divvy additionally provides pairwise comparisons between each stock in the portfolio. If the user wishes to replace either of the stocks in the "least diverse" pair (the stocks that have been behaving most like one another over the previous quarter), the algorithm will then draw from the pool of stocks described above and return a selection of diversifying stocks that meet a minimum performance criterion (decent volume, decent recent historic performance). If the quarter that the user is working in is the first, second, or third of 2018, the user can then go on to assess how well each suggested replacement did in the following quarter, and compare that to the stock that they would have been replacing. 

Finally, if you find that this algorithm is working for you, you can apply it to your current portfolio using the fourth quarter 2018 data to find suggested replacement stocks for the first quarter of 2019. 

Divvy is NOT meant to be a robo-investor; Divvy is meant to be a stock market travel guide. Even professional stock analysts focus on only one sector of the market at a time, because the sheer number of publicly traded stocks can be overwhelming. By getting you out of your market knowledge bubble - away from the S&P 500 and companies that you interact with on a daily basis - Divvy can help you to learn something about the broader and even international markets, and to escape the curse of large-scale reflexivity (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reflexivity.asp).  

I've very much enjoyed applying DivvyUp to my own portfolio, and I hope that you enjoy this adventure as well. Please check back in for upates at the end of the first quarter of 2019!
